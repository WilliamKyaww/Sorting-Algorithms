# Sorting-Algorithm

A benchmark tool for sorting algorithms, streamlining benchmarking, comparison, and visualisation of their respective time complexities.

The scripts basic_cli.py and basic_gui.py are the basic command-line and graphical user interfaces for the benchmark tool, that I coded during my first year of university. 

Note: The file gui.py is created through Claude Opus 4.6. It is **NOT** my work. It's just created as a fast and modifiable representation of the sorting algorithms.
